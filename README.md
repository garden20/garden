The Garden platform for html5 apps
==================================

See http://garden20.com

This repo is mainly for the triage of issues into the proper sub-project. 

Garden Subprojects include:

 - [Garden Market](https://github.com/garden20/garden-market). A market or app store. Developers upload apps to this, and users install apps from here. A live market can be seen [Garden20 Market](http://garden20.com/market). Feel free to host your own market, as this is an open platform.
 - [Dashboard](https://github.com/garden20/dashboard). Runs in a garden to provide a welcome page, a top menu bar, and app installation and management.
 - [Garden Cloud](https://github.com/garden20/garden-cloud). This the [Garden20](http://garden20.com) frontpage, and handles provisioning of online gardens from a hosting provider.


The name 'Garden' pays tribute to the original [Garden project](https://couchapp.org/page/garden)  by [J Chris Anderson](https://twitter.com/jchris).
